This repo is currently IN PROGRESS. It is meant to serve as an example of how to get Keycloak to authenticate incoming users at the reverse proxy level via NGINX. There is a basic angular application behind this.

Official documentation from NGINX: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/deployment-guides/single-sign-on/keycloak/
- This documentation however is for NGINX Plus. Which is a commercial product. This may not be possible with out a custom plugin.
